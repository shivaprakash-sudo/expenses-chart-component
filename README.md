## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- React - JS library
- TypeScript
- SCSS/SASS - CSS preprocessor

### What I learned

- Displaying dynamic chart data while type checking using TypeScript to ensure correct data is displayed.
- Using TypeScript with React.
- TypeScript is a pain in the a\*s, but worth it.

### Continued development

I would like to build more projects and learn more on using React with TypeScript.
